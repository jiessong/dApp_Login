# dApp_Login
A simple demo to illustrate how to login with decentralised (Web 3.0) technique to improve security. 
By creating a react app, we complete the login authentication relying on Metamask (blockchain) account. 
In such a way, the user not only reply on the username and password for the login, but also the decentralised account, which improves the security.
